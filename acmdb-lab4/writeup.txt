*  Describe any design decisions you made.

    I implemented basic histogram estimator, nothing special.

*  Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.

    I created a base class for Histograms, which abstracted the methods to get selectivity result.

*  Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

    No missing elements.

*  Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything
   you found particularly difficult or confusing.

   I spent about 2 hours and a half on the lab. 

   I also tried to create a base class method for Field to simplify my TableStat process, however, it won't pass the test because 'Assertion' will be ambiguous to compare two Integers.
